## Notes

### Logical vs Primary Partition

The Master Boot Record Partition scheme only allows for 4 primary partitions.
To get around this we create an extended partition that contains logical partitions.
Windows can't boot from logical partitions, only primary one.

### LVM (Logical Volume Management)

A device mapper framework that provides logical volume management,
i.e. the creation and use of logical partitions.

### Linux directory structure

- `/`: The root directory
- `/bin`: Binaries accessible to everyone
- `/dev`: Device files
- `/etc`: Configuration files
- `/usr`: User binaries and program data
  - `/usr/bin`: contains basic user commands
  - `/usr/sbin`: contains additional commands for the administrator
  - `/usr/lib`: contains the system libraries
  - `/usr/share`: contains documentation or common to all libraries, like `/usr/share/man`.
- `/home`: User personal data
- `/lib`: Shared libraries
- `/sbin`: System/Super/Sudo binaries (that can only be run by root or a sudo user)
- `/tmp`: Temporary files
- `/var`: Variable data files (like logs)
- `/boot`: Boot files, usually a separate partition is mounted here.
- `/proc`: Process and kernel files like `/proc/cpuinfo`
- `/opt`: Optional/3rd-party software
- `/root`: The home directory of the root
- `/media`: Mount point for removable media
- `/mnt`: Mount directory for file systems by sysadmins
- `/srv`: Service data, like web apps

### Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) vs. AppArmor

They're both Linux kernel security modules.

Fedora and CentOS use SELinux by default.
Debian and Ubuntu use AppArmor by default.

AppArmor is easier to use but less secure.
SELinux is harder to use but it's more secure.

### Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW)

A program that manages the Netfilter firewall framework, native to the Linux kernel.
UFW ships default with Ubuntu.

### aptitude vs. apt vs. apt-get

They're all package managers that use `dpkg` behind the scenes.
They all use the same repositories.

`aptitude` provides a terminal menu interface with `ncurses`
and it's easier to use.
Advanced Packaging Tool (`apt`) and `apt-get` are a collection of CLI tools.
`apt-get` was the first sub-project of `apt`.

Debian comes with `apt` by default.

### PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)

A suite of libraries that allows a Linux system administrator
to configure methods to authenticate users.
This is where we set the password policy.
