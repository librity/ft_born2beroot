## Notes

### Logical vs Primary Partition

The Master Boot Record Partition scheme only allows for 4 primary partitions.
To get around this we create an extended partition that contains logical partitions.

### LVM (Logical Volume Management)

### Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) vs. AppArmor

They're both Linux kernel security modules.

Fedora and CentOS use SELinux by default.
Debian and Ubuntu use AppArmor by default.

AppArmor is easier to use but less secure.
SELinux is harder to use but it's more secure.

### Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW)

A program that manages the Netfilter firewall framework, native to the Linux kernel.
UFW ships default with Ubuntu.

### aptitude vs. apt vs. apt-get
