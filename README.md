## üìù Notes <a name = "notes"></a>

### Logical vs Primary Partition

The Master Boot Record Partition scheme only allows for 4 primary partitions.
To get around this we create an extended partition that contains logical partitions.
Windows can't boot from logical partitions, only primary one.

### LVM (Logical Volume Management)

A device mapper framework that provides logical volume management,
i.e. the creation and use of logical partitions.

### Encrypted volumes

It's highly recommended to encrypt your logical volumes,
especially the swap partition.
You don't need to go crazy with the password, this isn't the NSA.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png">
</p>

### systemd

A software suite that provides an array of system components.
Arch, CentOS, CoreOS, Debian, Fedora, Linux, Mageia,
Manjaro, openSUSE, Red, Solus, SUSE and Ubuntu come with it by default.

### Linux directory structure

- `/`: The root directory
- `/bin`: Binaries accessible to everyone
- `/dev`: Device files, like logical volumes
- `/etc`: Configuration files
- `/usr`: User binaries and program data
  - `/usr/bin`: contains basic user commands
  - `/usr/sbin`: contains additional commands for the administrator
  - `/usr/lib`: contains the system libraries
  - `/usr/share`: contains documentation or common to all libraries, like `/usr/share/man`
- `/home`: User personal data
- `/lib`: Shared libraries
- `/sbin`: System/Super/Sudo binaries (that can only be run by root or a sudo user)
- `/tmp`: Temporary files
- `/var`: Variable data files (like logs)
- `/boot`: Boot files, usually a primary partition is mounted here
- `/proc`: Process and kernel files like `/proc/cpuinfo`
- `/opt`: Optional/3rd-party software
- `/root`: The home directory of the root
- `/media`: Mount point for removable media
- `/mnt`: Mount directory for file systems by sysadmins
- `/srv`: Service data, like web apps

### Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) vs. AppArmor

They're both Linux kernel security modules.
They both provide Mandatory Access Control (MAC).

Fedora and CentOS use SELinux by default.
Debian and Ubuntu use AppArmor by default.

AppArmor is easier to use but a little less secure.
SELinux is harder to use but more secure.

Before any syscall the kernel check with AppArmor or SELinux
if the process is allowed to execute that command.
By configuring them we can restrict the actions
that subjects (processes) can perform
on objects (files, IO, memory, Network ports, etc.)

### Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW)

A program that manages the Netfilter firewall framework, native to the Linux kernel.
Ubuntu comes with UFW by default.

### aptitude vs. apt vs. apt-get

They're all package managers that use `dpkg` behind the scenes.
They all use the same repositories.

`aptitude` provides a terminal menu interface with `ncurses`
and it's easier to use.
Advanced Packaging Tool (`apt`) and `apt-get` are a collection of CLI tools.
`apt-get` was the first sub-project of `apt`.

Debian comes with `apt` by default.

### PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)

A suite of libraries that allows a Linux system administrator
to configure methods to authenticate users.
This is where we set the password policy.

### CPU Core (Physical) vs Thread (Virtual)

A CPU core is an independent processing unit that processes one command at a time.
It's a physical component inside a chip, mounted on a socket on the motherboard.
Modern chips, having multiple cores, need some way of sharing their processing
resources with many programs at the same time.

Threads solve this problem by distributing instructions to multiple cores.
They're virtual components that manage the CPU schedule.
They act like independent CPU
since programs interact with them as they would a core:
a thread receives a command,
sends it to an available core,
waits for it to execute and returns the value.

My computer runs on an
[Intel Core i7-7700HQ](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/97185/intel-core-i77700hq-processor-6m-cache-up-to-3-80-ghz/specifications.html).
It has 4 cores and 8 threads, so my system monitor list it as 8 virtual CPUs.

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/concurrency_vs_parallelism.svg">
</p>

### `monitoring.sh`

We have to write a monitoring script that broadcasts every 10 minutes
various system stats with `wall`:

```bash
Broadcast message from root@lpaulo-m42 (somewhere) (Tue Dec 21 00:30:01 2021):

  # Architecture: Linux lpaulo-m42 5.10.0-9-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.70-1 (2021-09-30) x86_64 GNU/Linux
  # Physical CPUs (cores): 2
  # Virtual CPUs (threads): 2
  # Memory Usage: 218/976MB (22.33%)
  # Disk Usage: 1.1/8.0GB (15%%)
  # CPU load: .14%
  # Last boot: 2021-12-20 09:49
  # LVM enabled: false
  # TCP Connections: 2 - ESTABLISHED
  # Logged-in Users: 2
  # IP address: 192.168.0.15
  # MAC address: 08:00:27:25:76:99
  # Sudo commands: 326
```

### FastCGI

Is a protocol that interfaces applications (like PHP)
to web servers (like lighttpd and apache);

### Bitcoin Core and `bitcoind`

I really wanted to run a bitcoin node on my server.
I even managed to install and configure `bitcoind`,
but whenever I started the server it would error out
due to insufficient disk space.
I don't have a lot of storage space available,
so I left it as is.

I really wanted to finish the config process and have a working node,
but I learned a lot about bitcoin during the process.
I'm sure I'll be running a full node when I get some better hardware
(I'm obsessed with blockchain and crypto if you haven't noticed yet).

### Tor **Bridge** Relay

Tor is a
[mix network protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mix_network)
that allows users to hide their IP by relaying requests through a chain of
three random proxies:

1. **The Guard**
2. **The Middle**
3. **The Exit**

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/mixnet.png">
</p>

The request is encrypted three times with three different keys.
Each relay decrypts the request with its corresponding key
and forwards it to the next except for **The Exit**,
which forwards the request to its intended destination.
The end receiver of the request can only see **The Exit**'s IP,
hiding the identity of the sender.
It can also be used to access restricted or illegal content
in countries that censor online traffic.

People from all over the world who believe in our fundamental right
to privacy, anonymity and free speech run proxy relays
that maintain the Tor network.
The more relays the network has,
the greater the amount of paths a request could take
and the harder it is to identify the sender.
It also runs faster.

In my Debian server I installed and configured a **Bridge** Relay,
which is a special type of **Middle** that doesn't list its IP publicly.
Users first have to connect to to the Tor network
to discover and use **Bridge** relays.
It's by far the easiest relay type to setup
and it requires the least amount of network resources.

## üõ∏ 42 S√£o Paulo <a name = "ft_sp"></a>

Part of the larger [42 Network](https://www.42.fr/42-network/),
[42 S√£o Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/) is a software engineering school
that offers a healthy alternative to traditional education:

- It doesn't have any teachers and classes.
- Students learn by cooperating
  and correcting each other's work (peer-to-peer learning).
- Its focus is as much on social skills as it is on technical skills.
- It's completely free to anyone that passes its selection process -
  [**The Piscine**](https://42.fr/en/admissions/42-piscine/)

It's an amazing school, and I'm grateful for the opportunity.
